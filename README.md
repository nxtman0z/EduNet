## 🚀 How to Use EduNet
### 1. Install Required Software  
- Download and install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (v8.0 or above recommended).  

### 2. Open the Simulation File  
- Launch Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Open **Edunet.pkt** from this repository  

### 3. Explore Network Topology  
- VLANs for departments: **Admin, IT, Library, Academic, WiFi, Server**  
- Router-on-a-Stick setup for **inter-VLAN routing**  
- WiFi Access Points connected to **VLAN 50**  
- Web Server hosted on **VLAN 99**  

### 4. Run Tests  
- Test **inter-VLAN communication** (e.g., ping across PCs in different VLANs)  
- Verify **DHCP IP allocation**  
- Test **WiFi connectivity**  
- Access the hosted **web server**  

### 5. Verify Web Server Access  
- Open a browser on any PC/mobile device in the topology  
- Enter the **static IP of the Web Server**  
- Confirm access to **university applications (e.g., student portal)**
